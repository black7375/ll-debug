* ll-debug

  low level debug tools!!\\
  You can debug with printing message.

  This code and docs fork from Claus Brunzema <mail@cbrunzema.de> 's [[http://www.cbrunzema.de/software.html#ll-debug][software page]].\\
  Not only the code but also the *document was forked*, so it might be different from what I thought or direction!!

** Why?
   ll-debug.el provides commands to support a low level debug style.\\
   It features quick insertion of various debug output statements and
   improved functions for commenting and uncommenting chunks of code.

   I don't use debuggers very much.\\
   I know they can be a big help in
   some situations and I tried some of them, but I find it almost
   always more direct/convenient/enlightening to put a quick =printf=
   into a critical area to see what is happening than to fire up a big
   clumsy extra program where it takes me ages just to step through to
   the interesting point.
   In order to avoid repeated typing of
   =printf("I AM HERE\n");= and similar stuff, I created
   =ll-debug-insert=. It inserts a statement into your
   sourcecode that will display a debug message. It generates
   unique messages on each invocation (the message consists of a big
   fat DEBUG together with a counter and the current filename).

   See variable =ll-debug-statement-alist= if you want to know which
   modes are currently supported by ll-debug. You can add new modes
   with =ll-debug-register-mode=.

   When I have found the buggy spot, I like to keep a version of the
   old code in place, just in case I mess things up.
   =ll-debug-copy-and-comment-region-or-line= helps here, it makes a
   copy of the current line (or the current region, if active) and
   comments out the original version.

   I always missed a keystroke that toggles the =comment state= of a
   line (or region) of sourcecode. I need to turn a line or a block of
   code on and off quickly. =ll-debug-toggle-comment-region-or-line=
   does just that.

   Finally, if you want to spit out the values of a lot of variables
   you can use =ll-debug-insert= with a C-u prefix arg. It calls
   mode-specific skeletons that keep asking for variable names (and
   sometimes format specifiers) in the minibuffer. If you just press
   return here the skeleton interaction ends and a statement to print
   the names and the values of the variables is inserted in the
   buffer.

   If you want to get rid of the debug messages, use
   =ll-debug-revert=. It finds and removes the lines with the debug
   output statements, asking for confirmation before it removes
   anything.


** Prerequisites:

   I made the latest version of ll-debug with the following emacs:
   GNU Emacs 27.1\\
   Please let me know if other versions work.


** Installation:

   Get the newest version of ll-debug.el via
   https://github.com/black7375/ll-debug

   Orginal version is
   http://www.cbrunzema.de/software.html#ll-debug

   and put it in your load-path. Add the following form to your init
   file (=~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el=):

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'll-debug)
   #+END_SRC

   Now you can bind ll-debug commands to keystrokes yourself or just
   call `ll-debug-install-suggested-keybindings'. It clobbers C-v,
   which may not be completely emacs-political-correct, but it happens
   to be the stuff I use daily, it is only a suggestion, blah, if you
   don't like it, don't use it blah blah, do it your own way blah bla
   blah and don't flame me....
   =ll-debug-install-suggested-keybindings= installs the following
   keybindings:

   C-v C-v   ll-debug-toggle-comment-region-or-line
   C-v v     ll-debug-uncomment-region-or-line
   C-v C-y   ll-debug-copy-and-comment-region-or-line
   C-v C-d   ll-debug-insert


*** Usage example 1:

    If you use =ll-debug-install-suggested-keybindings=, hitting C-v C-d
    in a c-mode buffer called =main.c= produces:

    #+BEGIN_SRC c
   printf("DEBUG-1-main.c\n");
#+END_SRC c

a second C-v C-d prints

#+BEGIN_SRC c
   printf("DEBUG-2-main.c\n");
    #+END_SRC

    and so on. The following conversation uses the variable output (the
    part in =[= and =]= takes place in the minibuffer):

    C-u C-v C-d [ foo <RET> s <RET> bar <RET> d <RET> baz <RET> f <RET> <RET> ]

    This gives:

    #+BEGIN_SRC c
   printf("DEBUG-3-main.c foo:%s  bar:%d  baz:%f\n", foo, bar, baz);
    #+END_SRC


*** Usage example 2:

    In a lisp-mode buffer called 'tree.lisp' this:

    C-v C-d
    C-v C-d
    C-u C-v C-d [ foo <RET> bar <RET> baz <RET> <RET> ]

    produces the following lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (CL:format t "DEBUG-1-tree.lisp~%")
    (CL:format t "DEBUG-2-tree.lisp~%")
    (CL:format t "DEBUG-3-tree.lisp foo:~S  bar:~S  baz:~S~%" foo bar baz)
#+END_SRC


*** Usage example 3:

    The keybindings installed via
    =ll-debug-install-suggested-keybindings= will call an alternative
    versions for variable output if one ore more C-u prefix args are
    given. An alternative version is currently available in (c)perl-mode
    only. So, in a (c)perl-mode buffer called =answer.pl= these keys

    C-u C-u C-v C-d [ @quux <RET> %thud <RET> $grunt <RET> <RET> ]

    produce:

    #+BEGIN_SRC perl
print "DEBUG-1-answer.pl ", Data::Dumper->Dump([\@quux, \%thud, $grunt], [qw/*quux *thud grunt/]), "\n";
    #+END_SRC


** Customisation:

   You can use a different string for the debug messages by setting the
   variable =ll-debug-output-prefix=. If you set it e.g. to `"# DEBUG-"`
   your debug output won't disturb gnuplot datafiles anymore.

   If you don't like c++'s streams, you can request the printf style
   output by putting the following in your init file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (setcdr (assq =c++-mode ll-debug-statement-alist)
         (cdr (assq =c-mode ll-debug-statement-alist)))
   #+END_SRC


   If you want to have dynamic output not only according to the major
   mode, you can substitute functions in =ll-debug-statement-alist=.
   For example, the following snippet uses prefix =printk= instead of
   =printf= if you are editing c-sources in a file on a path
   containing a =linux= component:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 (setf (ll-debug-struct-prefix (cdr (assq 'c-mode
                                          ll-debug-statement-alist)))
        #'(lambda ()
            (if (string-match "linux" (buffer-file-name))
                "printk("
              "printf(")))
   #+END_SRC


   Please read the documentation for =ll-debug-insert= and
   =ll-debug-expand= to see what is possible.


   If you want to teach ll-debug new modes, see
   =ll-debug-register-mode= and consider sending a patch to
   <mail@cbrunzema.de>.

** ToDo:
*** me
- Other language support. like JS.

*** original
- Check if the strange log calculation in ll-debug-insert is really
  necessary. I want the number of C-u keypresses to dispatch
  alternatives on the content slot value of a ll-debug-struct, but
  every C-u multiplies prefix-numeric-value by 4. Is there a better
  way to do this?
- Make preferred output stream customizable.
